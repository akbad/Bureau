# Global context for Gemini CLI & Codex (always read first)

You ***must* read these essential files** using the appropriate read tool:
- before starting any task
- at the beginning of any conversation

## MANDATORY MEMORY STORAGE PROTOCOL

**CRITICAL & NON-NEGOTIABLE REQUIREMENT FOR *ALL* AGENTS**

After completing ANY task involving analysis, thinking, problem-solving, or discovery, you MUST:

1. **Store insights in Qdrant MCP** (`qdrant-store`):
   - Solutions found and why they worked
   - Patterns discovered, gotchas learned, insights gained
   - Root causes, symptoms, fix approaches for bugs
   - Performance bottlenecks, optimizations, metrics
   - Design decisions, trade-offs, alternatives rejected

2. **Track relationships in Memory MCP** (`create_entities`, `create_relations`):
   - Project components, modules, dependencies
   - System architecture, data flows, integration points
   - Who owns what, what tools are used where

3. **Ask before completing:** "Would future agents benefit from this?" → YES = STORE IT

**Failure to store memories = failure to complete the task.**

## [MCP tools available: quick reference]({{REPO_ROOT}}/agents/reference/compact-mcp-list.md)

> **Read**: `@{{REPO_ROOT}}/agents/reference/compact-mcp-list.md`

Contains:

   - Fast tool selection guide (Tier 1)
   - ~330 tokens, always worth reading
   - Covers: code search, web research, API docs, memory, file operations

## [Handoff guidelines]({{REPO_ROOT}}/agents/reference/handoff-guidelines.md)

> **Read**: `@{{REPO_ROOT}}/agents/reference/handoff-guidelines.md`

Covers:

   - When to delegate work to other agents/models using Zen's `clink` MCP tool
   - How to select the model/CLI to use when spawning agents (Codex/Gemini/Claude)
   - When to ask user vs handle directly
   - What requires explicit approval

## Further must-read notes

### Read these every time, even when spawned with a specific role

Even when using specialized roles, these files provide:

- Critical orchestration context
- Up-to-date tool limits and quotas
- Delegation decision trees
- Model-specific strengths and use cases

If a specialized role is being used, it may reference additional must-read files specific to its domain. Always check the role prompt for domain-specific references.

### Note for Gemini & Codex (GPT)

You are running via Gemini CLI or Codex, not Claude Code. This means:

- Use **`clink`** for ALL delegation (never use the `Task` tool - that's Claude Code-only)
- You have access to the same MCPs as Claude Code
- Role prompts are loaded from `~/.zen/cli_clients/systemprompts/clink-role-prompts/`
- Configurations are in `~/.zen/cli_clients/*.json`

## Superpowers System *(Codex-only)*

<EXTREMELY_IMPORTANT>
You have superpowers. Superpowers teach you new skills and capabilities. RIGHT NOW run: `~/.codex/superpowers/.codex/superpowers-codex bootstrap` and follow the instructions it returns.
