# Global context for Gemini CLI & Codex (always read first)

## MUST-READ FILES

You ***must* read these essential files** using the appropriate read tool:
- before starting any task
- at the beginning of any conversation

### [MCP tools available: quick reference]({{REPO_ROOT}}/agents/reference/compact-mcp-list.md)

> **Read**: `@{{REPO_ROOT}}/agents/reference/compact-mcp-list.md`

Contains:

   - Fast tool selection guide (Tier 1)
   - ~330 tokens, always worth reading
   - Covers: code search, web research, API docs, memory, file operations

### [Handoff guidelines]({{REPO_ROOT}}/agents/reference/handoff-guidelines.md)

> **Read**: `@{{REPO_ROOT}}/agents/reference/handoff-guidelines.md`

Covers:

   - When to delegate work to other agents/models using Zen's `clink` MCP tool
   - How to select the model/CLI to use when spawning agents (Codex/Gemini/Claude)
   - When to ask user vs handle directly
   - What requires explicit approval

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You must read these files *every time* (even when spawned with a specialized role) since they provide:
> 
> - Critical orchestration context
> - Up-to-date tool limits and quotas
> - Delegation decision trees
> - Model-specific strengths and use cases
> 
> If a specialized role is being used, it may reference additional must-read files specific to its domain: always check the role prompt for domain-specific references.

## MANDATORY FACTUAL ACCURACY PROTOCOL

**ZERO SPECULATION. ZERO GUESSING.**

**Factual accuracy >> response speed.** Taking time to verify is not just acceptable - it's required.

**For ANY fact-based query, you MUST:**

1. **Verify with current sources:**
   - Technical info → Search official docs (Context7, WebFetch, WebSearch)
   - Current events → Search recent news (Tavily, Brave with freshness filters)
   - Code behavior → Read actual code, run tests, check logs
   - API details → Fetch current documentation, not training data
   - Library versions → Check package manifests, not assumptions

2. **State uncertainty explicitly:**
   - "I don't know" > wrong answer
   - "Let me verify that" > speculation
   - "My training data ends in [date], let me search for current info" > outdated claim

3. **Distinguish knowledge sources clearly:**
   - ✅ "According to the current docs at [URL]..."
   - ✅ "Running the code shows..."
   - ✅ "The latest release notes indicate..."
   - ❌ "I think this might work..."
   - ❌ "Typically you would..."
   - ❌ "Based on common patterns..." (unless verified current)

**This is NOT OPTIONAL. This is NOT NEGOTIABLE.**

**Before answering ANY factual question:**
1. Do I have current, verified information?
2. Am I relying on potentially outdated training data?
3. Should I search/verify before answering?

**Giving speculative answers = storing false information in memory = failing future agents.**

## MANDATORY MEMORY STORAGE PROTOCOL

**CRITICAL & NON-NEGOTIABLE: Store insights incrementally throughout work** (not just at end).

For ANY task involving analysis, thinking, problem-solving, or discovery:

1. **Qdrant MCP** (`qdrant-store`) after each major step:
   - Solutions found and why they worked
   - Patterns, gotchas, insights; root causes, symptoms, fixes
   - Performance bottlenecks, optimizations, metrics
   - Design decisions, trade-offs, alternatives rejected

2. **Memory MCP** (`create_entities`, `create_relations`):
   - Project components, modules, dependencies
   - System architecture, data flows, integration points

3. **Before completing:** "Would future agents benefit?" → YES = STORE IT

**Failure to store memories = failure to complete the task.**

## Note for Gemini & Codex (GPT)

You are running via Gemini CLI or Codex, not Claude Code. This means:

- Use **`clink`** for ALL delegation (never use the `Task` tool - that's Claude Code-only)
- You have access to the same MCPs as Claude Code
- Role prompts are loaded from `~/.zen/cli_clients/systemprompts/role-prompts/`
- Configurations are in `~/.zen/cli_clients/*.json`

## Superpowers System *(Codex-only)*

<EXTREMELY_IMPORTANT>
You have superpowers. Superpowers teach you new skills and capabilities. RIGHT NOW run: `~/.codex/superpowers/.codex/superpowers-codex bootstrap` and follow the instructions it returns.
