# Global context (always read first)

You ***must* read these essential files** using the Read tool:
- before starting any task 
- at the beginning of any conversation

## [MCP tools available: quick reference](../reference/compact-mcp-list.md)

> **Read**: `@../reference/compact-mcp-list.md`

Contains: 

   - Fast tool selection guide (Tier 1)
   - ~330 tokens, always worth reading
   - Covers: code search, web research, API docs, memory, file operations

## [Handoff guidelines](../reference/handoff-guidelines.md)

> **Read**: `@../reference/handoff-guidelines.md`

Covers: 

   - When to delegate work to subagents (using either Zen's `clink` or the Claude subagent *Task* tool)
   - How to select the model/CLI to use with the subagent that you spawn (Codex/Gemini/Claude)
   - When to ask user vs handle directly
   - What requires explicit approval

> ## Read these every time, even when spawned as a specialized agent
> 
> Even when using specialized agents, these files provide:
> - Critical orchestration context
> - Up-to-date tool limits and quotas
> - Delegation decision trees
> - Model-specific strengths and use cases
> 
> If a specialized agent is being used, it will have additional must-read files specific to its domain. Always check the agent's frontmatter for domain-specific references.
