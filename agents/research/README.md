# Resaerch agents

> **Workflow: *how to research with these agents***
>
> 1.  The **Specifier** creates the research plan.
> 2.  The **Executor** executes the plan to gather all raw findings.
>     - It delegates per-source summarization and extraction tasks to the **Extractor**.
> 3.  The **Synthesizer** takes the Executor's raw findings and produces the final, synthesized answer(s).

## [Research specifier](research-specifier.md)

Use when you:

1. Have a broad, ambiguous or complex topic to research 
2. Need to turn it into a structured plan before work begins.

## [Research executor](research-executor.md)

Use to:

- Execute a structured research plan (such as one generated by the research specifier)
- Handle a straightforward research quer from start to finish

## [Research synthesizer](research-synthesizer.md)

Use to:

- Consolidate findings from multiple sources into a coherent, insightful analysis
- Identify themes, contradictions, and assess evidence from disparate research outputs
