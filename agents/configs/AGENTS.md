# Global context for Gemini & Codex CLIs (always read first)

You ***must* read these essential files** using the appropriate read tool:
- before starting any task
- at the beginning of any conversation

## [MCP tools available: quick reference](../reference/compact-mcp-list.md)

> **Read**: `@../reference/compact-mcp-list.md`

Contains:

   - Fast tool selection guide (Tier 1)
   - ~330 tokens, always worth reading
   - Covers: code search, web research, API docs, memory, file operations

## [Handoff guidelines](../reference/handoff-guidelines.md)

> **Read**: `@../reference/handoff-guidelines.md`

Covers:

   - When to delegate work to other agents/models using Zen's `clink` MCP tool
   - How to select the model/CLI to use when spawning agents (Codex/Gemini/Claude)
   - When to ask user vs handle directly
   - What requires explicit approval

## Further must-read notes

### Read these every time, even when spawned with a specific role

Even when using specialized roles, these files provide:

- Critical orchestration context
- Up-to-date tool limits and quotas
- Delegation decision trees
- Model-specific strengths and use cases

If a specialized role is being used, it may reference additional must-read files specific to its domain. Always check the role prompt for domain-specific references.

### Note for Gemini & Codex (GPT)

You are running via Gemini CLI or Codex CLI, not Claude Code. This means:

- Use **`clink`** for ALL delegation (never use the `Task` tool - that's Claude Code-only)
- You have access to the same MCPs as Claude Code
- Role prompts are loaded from `~/.zen/cli_clients/systemprompts/clink-role-prompts/`
- Configurations are in `~/.zen/cli_clients/*.json`
