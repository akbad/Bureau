## Terminology

| Concept | Definition |
| :------ | :--------- |
| **Skill** | *Superpowers* workflow (e.g., `superpowers:test-driven-development`) + any extra Claude/Codex skills files you define |
| **Agent** |  Personas used by agents (e.g., `debugger`, `architect`), invoked either directly in your main chat or as subagents |
| **Subagent** | A child **agent**, isolated from the main chat, spawned to complete a particular task by *either* (1) Claude Code first-party "subagents" feature or (2) `clink` |
| **MCP** | MCP servers made available for you to use; see `compact-mcp-list.md` (on your list of must-read files) for a full guide |

## Core delegation strategies

### Delegation mechanisms available

1. `clink` (from Zen MCP, available everywhere): Cross-model orchestration to Claude, Codex (GPT‑5.1‑Codex), Gemini
2. `Task` tool (Claude‑only): Spawn specialized Claude Code subagents
3. `AskUserQuestion`: Stop and obtain explicit user guidance

### Delegation principles

- Delegate when another model or role materially improves accuracy, speed, cost, or context handling.
- Ask the user when requirements are ambiguous, multiple valid options exist, or explicit approval is required.
- Handle directly when the task is within your capability and scope is clear.

### Integration with *Superpowers* skills *(Claude and Codex only)*

#### Precedence rule when both systems apply

1. **Process enforcement (*Superpowers*)**: If a *Superpowers* skill mandates a specific workflow (e.g., TDD, systematic debugging), you MUST follow it — this is non-negotiable per the skill's requirements.
2. **Capability selection**: Within that mandated workflow, use handoff guidelines (this file) and model selection guide to choose:

    - Which model/CLI to use (`clink` with appropriate role)
    - Which MCP tools to leverage (per `compact-mcp-list.md`)
    - When to delegate vs. handle directly

#### Both systems are complementary

- *Superpowers* defines ***how** to work*
- `handoff-guidelines.md` defines ***who** does it*
- `mcp-compact-list.md` defines ***which tools** are used*

For example, suppose you are performing a debugging task. Examples of what could be enforced by each system:

| System | What it enforces/leads you to do |
| :-- | :-- |
| Superpowers | Use `systematic-debugging` skill (4-phase investigation process) |
| "Handoff guidelines" and "Compact MCP list" guides | Use Codex via `clink` with `debugger` role + Serena MCP for code search |

## Delegation mechanisms (detailed)

### Quick comparison

| Mechanism | CLI Support | Primary Use Cases | When to Use |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`clink`** | All CLIs | Cross-model delegation, specialized roles | Different model needed (see [decision tree](#decision-tree-quick-reference)), isolated context required |
| **`Task`** | Claude only | Claude subagents, exploration, research | Codebase exploration, parallel searches, multi-step research |
| **`AskUserQuestion`** | All CLIs | User guidance, approval gates | Ambiguity, multiple valid approaches, explicit approval needed |

### Using `clink`

**When to use:**
- Cross-model collaboration is beneficial (see [decision tree](#decision-tree-quick-reference) for which model to choose)
- Spawning a specialized role with isolated context
- Task requires capabilities better suited to a different model

**CLI-specific rules:**
- **Claude Code**: Use `clink` for delegation to Codex or Gemini (use `Task` for Claude subagents)
- **Codex/Gemini**: Use `clink` for all delegation (no `Task` tool available)

**How to use:**
- Provide `cli_name` (`claude`, `codex`, `gemini`), clear `prompt`, and `role` (from clink role prompts directory)
- Always reuse `continuation_id` to preserve conversation context
- Include absolute file paths when relevant

**Special: Explore and Plan agents**

For `Explore` and `Plan` agents, specify thoroughness in your prompt:

| Thoroughness | Result |
| :--- | :--- |
| `"quick"` | Basic pattern matching, fast lookups |
| `"medium"` | Moderate exploration across multiple files |
| `"very thorough"` | Comprehensive analysis across entire codebase |

### Using `Task` tool *(Claude Code only)*

**When to use:**
- Codebase exploration (Explore agent with configurable thoroughness)
- Multi-step research tasks and token-conserving searches
- Parallelizing independent search/analysis tasks

**When NOT to use:**
- Single known file reads or known symbol queries (use direct tools instead)
- Cross-model delegation (use `clink` instead)

### Using `AskUserQuestion`

See [When to ask the user](#when-to-ask-the-user-askuserquestion) section for complete guidance.

## Parallel delegation strategies

### When to parallelize

Spawn multiple subagents **concurrently** (not sequentially) when tasks are:
- **Independent**: No data dependencies between them
- **Parallelizable**: Can execute simultaneously without coordination
- **Time-consuming**: Research, analysis, exploration, code search
- **Mergeable**: Results can be combined afterward

### How to parallelize

**Critical:** Use **multiple tool calls in a single response** to launch parallel subagents.

**Example (correct - parallel execution):**
```
Let me analyze these 4 modules in parallel using clink:
[Launches 4 clink calls in one message]
```

**Anti-pattern (sequential execution):**
```
Let me analyze module A first...
[waits for response]
Now let me analyze module B...
[waits for response]
```

### Common parallelization patterns

1. **Multi-module analysis**
   - Spawn N subagents, one per module/package/service
   - Merge findings after all complete

2. **Dependency research**
   - Research 5 libraries in parallel (features, security, compatibility)
   - Compare results in single summary

3. **Cross-codebase search**
   - Search multiple repos/branches concurrently
   - Aggregate results

4. **Independent refactors**
   - Refactor 3 unrelated files in parallel
   - Review all changes together

5. **Multi-step investigation**
   - Investigate 4 potential root causes simultaneously
   - Converge on likely culprit

### Default mindset

**Before starting work:** Ask "Can I break this into 2+ independent subtasks?"
- If **YES** → Spawn multiple subagents in parallel
- If **NO** → Handle directly or spawn single subagent

**Err toward parallelization.** Coordination overhead is minimal compared to sequential execution time.

## Choosing *models* when spawning subagents

### Decision tree (quick reference)

Use this flowchart for fast model selection based on **hard constraints** and **proven strengths**:

1. **Context >400K tokens?** → **Gemini 2.5 Pro** (1M context window; only option)
2. **Math-heavy work** (DB/ML/optimization) **+ context ≤400K?** → **GPT-5.1-Codex** with **High thinking** (superior math/code accuracy)
3. **Mechanical refactors, multi-file changes, testing?** → **GPT-5.1-Codex** (proven strength for repo-wide changes)
4. **Fast iterations, CI fixes, simple tasks?** → **Claude Haiku 4.5** (speed)
5. **Maximum rigour, highest-impact decisions?** → **Claude Opus 4.5** (use sparingly; strict weekly limits)
6. **Default for most other tasks?** → **GPT-5.1-Codex** or **Claude Sonnet 4.5** (both capable; choose based on task table below, personal preference, or availability)

### Thinking level optimization

When delegating via `clink`, adjust thinking levels in your prompt for better performance:

**Codex (effort levels):**
- `"minimal effort"` — formatting, regex, simple text transforms
- `"low effort"` — single-file edits, straightforward changes
- *(default)* — cross-file analysis, moderate complexity
- `"high effort"` — migrations, concurrency, complex refactors, math-heavy work

**Claude (extended thinking):**

Add `"extended thinking"` to your prompt for:
- Long-horizon refactors, complex architectural decisions
- Root cause analysis (RCAs), incident investigations
- Multi-service planning, system design
- Complex research requiring deep reasoning

## Handoff patterns

Follow the sequential flow of phases in the table below (in the order presented):

| Order | Phase name | Objectives | Actions to perform |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | **Research** | Understand requirements, code, and constraints | Use `Task` Explore (Claude) for codebase exploration; use direct read/glob for known files/symbols; use `clink`→Gemini for long‑context needs (>~400K). If ambiguity remains, see [AskUserQuestion](#when-to-ask-the-user-askuserquestion) |
| **2** | **Planning** | Design the approach, break down tasks, identify risks | Outline steps; note trade‑offs; delegate complex architecture to Claude (`architect`) or refactoring planning to Codex (`migration-refactoring`) via `clink`. For large goals, use `task-decomposer` to produce verifiable substeps and dependencies. Resolve ambiguities via [AskUserQuestion](#when-to-ask-the-user-askuserquestion). See [What requires explicit approval, always](#what-requires-explicit-approval-always) before proceeding. |
| **3** | **Implementation** | Execute the plan and write changes | Track tasks; use Codex for wide refactors/testing; use Claude for coordination; use Gemini for long‑context codebase analysis. Leverage specialist roles as needed (e.g., `schema-evolution`, `auth-specialist`, `caching-specialist`, `event-driven`, `debugger`). Also see [what requires explicit approval, always](#what-requires-explicit-approval-always) before proceeding. |
| **4** | **Review/Verification (optional)** | Verify changes, run tests, prepare for commit | Request code review (use `code-reviewer` for structured guidance); run tests; follow the [Approval pattern](#approval-pattern) as needed. |

## When to ask the user (AskUserQuestion)

### When to ask

Ask the user when:
- Requirements are ambiguous, trade‑offs are uncited, or multiple valid approaches exist.
- High‑impact architectural decisions are involved (system design, stack selection, breaking changes).
- Critical information is missing (configs, environment details).
- Security/compliance sensitivity exists (credentials, access control, retention).
- Before destructive operations or any action listed under “Explicit Approval”.

### Best practices
- Provide 2–4 clear options with concise trade‑offs; allow multi‑select when appropriate.
- Include context about why you’re asking; keep headers short.

### What requires <ins>explicit</ins> approval, <ins>always</ins>

- **Version control operations**: creating commits (unless explicitly told), pushing, merging, rebasing, force pushes, amending commits.

  - Exception: User explicitly says "commit this" or "push these changes".

- **Destructive operations**: deleting files/dirs, truncating databases, dropping tables, purging caches, removing dependencies.

  - *Exception*: User explicitly says "delete X" or removal is part of an explicitly approved refactoring task.

- **Production/deployment**: prod deploys, prod config changes, service restarts, env var changes, prod migrations.

  - Never assume: always ask even if user says "deploy".

- **Security/access changes**: authN/Z changes, permission grants, exposing endpoints, disabling security features, handling secrets.
- **Breaking changes**: public API removals, signature changes without backward compatibility, schema changes without migrations, config format changes.

  - *Exception*: Proceed only with explicit user approval for the breaking change.

- **Cost‑impacting changes**: adding cloud resources, increasing instance size, storage tier changes, rate‑limit changes, adding paid third‑party services.

#### Approval pattern

1. Clearly state what will happen
2. List affected resources/files
3. Explain potential risks/impacts
4. Use AskUserQuestion with clear options
5. Wait for explicit approval
6. Proceed only after approval
