## MCP servers

### MCP servers for browsing/researching/fetching stuff from the internet

A few of these servers have redundant/duplicate roles. This is on purpose so we have fallback choices in case we hit rate limits.

| Server | Functionality | How it's run/talked to by agents | Restrictions |
| :----- | :------------ | :------------ | :----------- |
| **Fetch MCP** | fetch HTTP/HTTPS URLs; turns HTML into Markdown for faster/more accurate processing by LLMs (optional raw HTML); chunk reading via start_index; custom UA/robots handling | Stdio with private client-managed instance | None |
| **Firecrawl MCP** | crawl/scrape/extract/map websites; "better" web search; batching & deep research | **Claude & Codex**: HTTP using Firecrawl's cloud-hosted server; **Gemini**: stdio with local proxy that talks to Firecrawl's cloud server | [Free plan](https://www.firecrawl.dev/pricing) used, limits are 10 `/scrape` calls/min, 1 `/crawl` call/min, each uses 1 credit. **Looks like you need to make a new account/API key after 500 total scrapes/crawls** |
| **Context7 MCP** | pull up-to-date, version-specific API/code docs & examples into prompts | **Claude & Gemini**: HTTP using Context7's cloud-hosted server; **Codex**: stdio with local proxy that talks to Context7's cloud server | Free tier used: **only allows accessing *public* repos** | 
| **Sourcegraph MCP** | Basically **“Google for code”**: lets your agent search across repos (and branches) using powerful filters (regex, language, and file-path), then open the matching files/line ranges to pull the exact code snippets you're looking for. Also includes **guided search prompts**, so the agent can turn a natural request (e.g., “find all places we construct HttpClient with a 5s timeout”) into precise queries and iterate until it finds what you need. | Free tier used: search covers **public repos only**; covering private/org repos requires paid plans | HTTP with locally-run server (that talks to [Sourcegraph Public Code Search](https://sourcegraph.com/search)) |
| **Tavily MCP** | Handles searching, extracting, mapping and crawling the web, with citations | HTTP with Tavily's cloud-hosted server | Free version used: gives 1000 API credits/month (resets on 1st of month); *[click to see amount of credits used for each request type](https://docs.tavily.com/documentation/api-credits#api-credits-costs)* | 
| [**Brave MCP**](https://github.com/brave/brave-search-mcp-server) | Privacy-focused fallback/alternative search engine with generous free tier | stdio with private client-managed instances | Free tier used: 2000 queries/month, limited to basic web search only |
| [**Exa MCP**](https://github.com/exa-labs/exa-mcp-server) | Neural search engine optimized specifically for LLMs and AI agents: has better semantic understanding than traditional keyword search and returns content formatted for AI consumption. Complements Tavily's general-purpose search with its AI-native approach, and comes out superior for research and knowledge discovery | HTTP with Exa's cloud-hosted server | Free plan used with one time credit of $10. **Looks like you need to make a new account/API key once you've used this up** |

> Important: 
> - **The *Fetch* MCP does not support fetching directly from the GitHub website** (e.g. to look up API-/code-related info about public repos) 
> - Instead, tell the agent to use one of these solutions, depending on what you need from GitHub: 
>     - **Best / most straightforward:**
>
>         - Use Fetch MCP to fetch from `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<path>`, where `<path>` is usually something like `<user/org>/<repo>/<dir>/<file>`
>         - Use `gh` CLI locally
>
>     - **Other solutions:**
>
>         - Use Sourcegraph MCP
>         - Clone repos locally and use Git MCP to go through them
 
### MCP memory servers

| Server | Functionality | How it's run/talked to by agents | Restrictions |
| :----- | :------------ | :------------ | :----------- |
| **Qdrant MCP** | *semantic memory* layer: allows agent to save things it learns/produces (code snippets, notes, links) and later retrieve them by searching *semantically* (i.e. not just by keyword); uses FastEmbed models w/ HNSW index for search | HTTP with locally-running server, backed by *Qdrant DB instance running in a local Docker container* | None |
| **Memory MCP** | *structured memory* layer (knowledge graph): stores entities, relations, and observations to track *relationships* between concepts and maintain context across sessions; complements Qdrant's semantic search with explicit relationship tracking | Stdio with private client-managed instances | None (completely free, local JSONL storage) | 

#### Claude-only: `claude-mem` context management plugin

**What it is**: A persistent memory compression system that automatically preserves context across Claude Code sessions. Unlike Qdrant/Memory MCPs which require manual saving, claude-mem operates fully automatically through Claude Code's plugin hook system. GitHub repo: [thedotmack/claude-mem](https://github.com/thedotmack/claude-mem)

**How it works automatically**:
- **5 Lifecycle Hooks** capture events without manual intervention:
  - `SessionStart`: Injects summaries from last 10 sessions into context with progressive disclosure (token costs visible)
  - `UserPromptSubmit`: Creates session record, saves raw user prompts for search
  - `PostToolUse`: Fires after EVERY tool execution (Read, Write, Edit, Bash, etc.), captures observations
  - `Stop`: Generates session summaries (request, completed, learned, next_steps)
  - `SessionEnd`: Marks sessions complete (graceful cleanup, preserves work across `/clear`)
- **Worker Service** (PM2-managed Express server on port 37777):
  - Processes observations via Claude Agent SDK
  - Extracts structured learnings: decisions, bugfixes, features, refactors, discoveries, changes
  - Auto-starts when first session begins
- **SQLite Database** (`~/.claude-mem/claude-mem.db`):
  - Stores sessions, observations, summaries, and user prompts
  - FTS5 full-text search with SQL injection protection (332 attack tests)
  - Tracks files read/modified, concepts, types, and relationships
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Context appears as layered timeline at session start
  - Layer 1 (Index): See what exists with token costs (🔴 critical, 🟤 decision, 🔵 informational)
  - Layer 2 (Details): Fetch full narratives on-demand via MCP search
  - Layer 3 (Perfect Recall): Access source code and original transcripts

**How agents can use it manually** (7 MCP search tools available in all Claude sessions):
- `search_observations` - Full-text search across observations (title, narrative, facts, concepts)
  - Filter by: type, concepts, files, project, date range
  - **Always start with `format: "index"` (50-100 tokens/result) before using `format: "full"` (500-1000 tokens/result)**
- `search_sessions` - Full-text search across session summaries
- `search_user_prompts` - Search raw user requests (trace intent → implementation)
- `find_by_concept` - Find observations tagged with specific concepts (e.g., "architecture", "security")
- `find_by_file` - Find all work related to specific files (e.g., "worker-service.ts")
- `find_by_type` - Find by observation type (decision, bugfix, feature, refactor, discovery, change)
- `get_recent_context` - Get recent session context for debugging/recovery
- **Citations**: All results use `claude-mem://` URIs for referencing historical context

**How Codex and Gemini CLIs can replicate this with Qdrant + Memory MCPs**:

Since Codex/Gemini lack Claude Code's hook system, they must manually implement similar patterns:

- **Manual observation logging** (replaces automatic hooks):
  - After reading code: Explicitly save discoveries to Qdrant (semantic search) + Memory MCP (knowledge graph)
  - After decisions: Create entities in Memory MCP with relations (e.g., "JWT" -[chosen_for]→ "authentication" -[because]→ "stateless design")
  - After fixes: Store bugfix observations in Qdrant with metadata (file, type, concepts)
  - Use Qdrant for semantic retrieval ("find work related to authentication") and Memory MCP for relationship traversal

- **Session summaries** (replaces Stop hook):
  - Before ending work, manually create summary and store in Qdrant
  - Include: request, completed, learned, next_steps (same structure as claude-mem)
  - Tag with project name and date for filtering

- **Context recovery** (replaces SessionStart hook):
  - Start sessions by searching Qdrant for relevant past work (semantic search by project/topic)
  - Fetch related entities from Memory MCP knowledge graph
  - Build context progressively as needed (similar to progressive disclosure)

- **File tracking** (replaces automatic file_read/file_modified tracking):
  - Manually create Memory MCP observations when reading/modifying files
  - Link files to concepts via relations (e.g., "auth.ts" -[implements]→ "JWT authentication")

- **Key differences**:
  - claude-mem is automatic (zero intervention), Qdrant+Memory requires agent discipline
  - claude-mem uses FTS5 full-text search, Qdrant uses vector/semantic search (different strengths)
  - claude-mem has typed observations (decision, bugfix, etc.), must manually tag in Qdrant/Memory
  - claude-mem uses Claude Agent SDK for AI extraction, Qdrant+Memory requires agent self-extraction
  - claude-mem tracks tool executions automatically, Qdrant+Memory requires explicit "save this" calls

- **Advantage of manual approach**: Works across all CLI agents (Codex, Gemini, Claude), not just Claude Code

## Non-MCP tools

| Tool | Type | Functionality |
| :--- | :--- | :------------ |
| **[GitHub SpecKit](https://github.github.io/spec-kit/) *(amazing, your agents will never hallucinate or get distracted again)*** | Command-line tool | Enables **Spec-Driven Development** via `specify` CLI, which allows making detailed constitution/spec/plan/tasks for each project; agent-agnostic templates (Copilot/Claude/Gemini) |

> There's a bit of a learning curve for getting to use GitHub SpecKit, but it's definitely worth it
