# Useful background info 

## MCP server types

- **Official/reference** servers are developed and maintained by the creators of MCP
    
    - Are standard, primary implementations that serve as models for how to build new MCPs  

- **Community** servers are developed by the community

## Ways of running MCP servers

Most MCP servers are run as **client-managed `stdio` servers**: 

- You configure your coding agent (e.g. using `claude mcp add ...`) to use that MCP, telling the command to use to run the server (usually something like `npx -y ...`)
- Then, the coding agent will start its own private instance of the server when launched and stop it when it's exited.

Some servers support being accessed remotely (being run either as a locally-running process or by an online service that you access with a URL + API key), which allows them to be reused by many agents.

| Method of talking to remote MCP servers | Use case | How it works |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **HTTP** | Best for MCPs whose toolcalls are quick & synchronous | Run the server once, `mcp add` command provides the server's URL; client then initiates exchanges w/ server via HTTP |
| **SSE *(deprecated in a lot of places, better to just always use HTTP)*** | Best for MCPs whose tools run for a long time, thus making progress updates useful; Agent CLI *and* MCP server **must support SSE** | Similar to `http`, except connection remains open instead of closing after each request. Client then stays listening, and server can "push" messages (via events) to the client whenever new data is available |

## Adding MCPs to coding agents

## Gemini CLI

> [***Full Gemini MCP guide***](https://geminicli.com/docs/tools/mcp-server/)
> 
> → [*Shortcut: guide to `gemini mcp` commands*](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/blob/main/docs/tools/mcp-server.md#managing-mcp-servers-with-gemini-mcp)

- Add servers with `gemini mcp add <name> <commandOrUrl> [args...]` 
    
    - Scope used determines which config file is changed: 

        - **Project scope *(default)*** → `~/.gemini/settings.json`
        - **User scope** → `~/.gemini/settings.json`
            
            - Use via `-s user` option

## Claude Code

> [***Full Claude Code MCP guide***](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/mcp)

- **Support for SSE servers is deprecated**; prefer HTTP servers instead 
- Can add MCP servers at these scopes (with `--scope <local|project|user>`):

    - **Local (*default*)**: for current repo
    - **Project**: changes current repo's `.mcp.json` so collaborators can reuse the same MCP setup
    - **User**: for Claude Code anywhere on your device (changes config in `~/.claude`)

- Listing and using available MCPs:

    - Type `@` to see available resources from all connected MCP servers (alongside files)
    - Use the format **`@server:protocol://resource/path`** to reference a resource, for example:

        > `Compare @postgres:schema://users with @docs:file://database/user-model`

## Codex

> [***Full Codex MCP guide***](https://developers.openai.com/codex/mcp)

- Adding MCP servers:
    
    - Options for `stdio` servers:

        1. **Edit `~/.codex/config.toml` config file** with this format:

            ```toml
            [mcp_servers.<server-name>]
            command = <server launch command>  # required
            args = <args for launch command>   # optional
            env = { "ENV_VAR" = "VALUE" }      # optional: env vars for server to use

            # alternate way of adding any env vars for server to use
            [mcp_servers.<server-name>.env]
            ENV_VAR = "VALUE"                 
            # ... repeat for each variable
            ```

            - Example:

                ```toml
                [mcp_servers.context7]
                command = "npx"
                args = ["-y", "@upstash/context7-mcp"]

                [mcp_servers.context7.env]
                SUNRISE_DIRECTION = "EAST"
                ```
            
        2. **Use shortcut command** (creates config entry for you): 

            ```bash
            codex mcp add <server-name> [--env <VAR=VALUE>]... -- <server launch command>
            ```
    
    - For `http` servers: **must edit `~/.codex/config.toml`** config file with this format:

        ```toml
        # optional: add this line if you want to use RMCP client to connect to server
        #           enables auth via OAuth for HTTP servers
        experimental_use_rmcp_client = true 

        [mcp_servers.<server-name>]
        url = <server URL>      # required
        bearer_token = <token>  # optional: bearer token to use in an `Authorization` header 
                                #           (if not using OAuth via RMCP above)
        ``` 

    - **Doesn't support SSE**; use HTTP servers instead
