---

#### Exa MCP **[SPECIALIZED SEARCH]**

**What it does:**

-   Neural search optimized for LLMs
-   Better semantic understanding than keyword search
-   AI-native result formatting
-   Superior for research and knowledge discovery

**When to use:**

-   Need semantic/conceptual search (not just keywords)
-   Research requiring deep understanding
-   Tavily and Brave don't find what you need
-   Task justifies using limited credits

**Rate limits:** $10 one-time credit (new account needed after exhaustion)

**Why use conditionally:** Limited credits, but excellent semantic capabilities

---

#### Firecrawl MCP ⚠️ **[LAST RESORT]**

**What it does:**

-   Advanced website crawling/scraping
-   Batch operations
-   Deep extraction and mapping

**When to use:**

-   **ONLY** when other tools cannot handle the task
-   Need deep multi-page crawling
-   Require batch processing
-   Complex extraction that Tavily/Fetch can't do

**Rate limits:**

-   10 `/scrape` calls/min
-   1 `/crawl` call/min
-   **CRITICAL: 500 lifetime limit before new account required**

**Why use last:** Severe lifetime limit - reserve for tasks requiring unique capabilities

---

#### Fetch MCP **[SIMPLE FALLBACK]**

**What it does:**

-   Basic HTTP/HTTPS URL fetching
-   Converts HTML to Markdown
-   Optional raw HTML
-   Chunk reading via start_index

**When to use:**

-   Simple one-off URL fetch
-   Don't need search/crawl/extraction
-   All other tools exhausted or overkill

**Rate limits:** None

**Limitations:**

-   **Does NOT support fetching directly from github.com** (fetch from `raw.githubusercontent.com` instead, or use `gh` CLI)

**Why use last:** No advanced features, but reliable and unlimited

---

### Memory & knowledge tools

#### Qdrant MCP ⭐ **[PRIMARY FOR SEMANTIC MEMORY]**

**What it does:**

-   Vector-based semantic memory layer using Qdrant database
-   Stores information with embeddings for semantic (meaning-based) retrieval
-   Uses FastEmbed models (default: sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2)
-   Can run locally or connect to cloud/remote Qdrant instances
-   Supports optional structured metadata alongside text

**Tools available:**

1.  `qdrant-store` - Store information with optional metadata
2.  `qdrant-find` - Retrieve semantically similar information by query

**When to use:**

-   Storing code snippets, notes, or links for later retrieval
-   Building a personal knowledge base across sessions
-   Need to find information by *meaning* rather than exact keywords
-   Want to search by concept or similarity (e.g., "authentication patterns" finds OAuth, JWT, etc.)
-   Storing learned insights from previous conversations
-   Building a semantic search layer for your own data

**When NOT to use:**

-   Need to track explicit relationships between items → Use Memory MCP instead
-   Need structured graph queries → Use Memory MCP instead
-   Simple keyword search is sufficient → Use grep/filesystem tools
-   One-time lookup (not worth storing) → Use web search tools directly

**Rate limits:** None (local Docker container or self-hosted)

**Best practices:**

-   Store atomic pieces of information (one concept per store)
-   Use metadata field for structure (e.g., `{"type": "code", "language": "python"}`)
-   Descriptive text helps retrieval (include context, not just code)
-   Good for: code patterns, solutions to problems, useful links, learned facts
-   Works great with Cursor/Windsurf for code snippet libraries

**Example use cases:**

-   "Store this React hook pattern for reuse later" → retrieves by describing what you need
-   Building a personal StackOverflow of solved problems
-   Remembering API patterns across different projects
-   Semantic code snippet search in your IDE

**Why use:** Best tool for "find things similar to X" - works like a persistent, intelligent search over your saved knowledge

---

#### Memory MCP ⭐ **[PRIMARY FOR KNOWLEDGE GRAPHS]**

**What it does:**

-   Persistent knowledge graph with entities, relations, and observations
-   Tracks explicit relationships between concepts/people/things
-   Stores structured information in local JSONL file
-   Maintains context and facts across sessions
-   Official MCP implementation by Anthropic

**Tools available:**

1.  `create_entities` - Create nodes in the graph (people, orgs, events, concepts)
2.  `create_relations` - Define directed relationships between entities (in active voice)
3.  `add_observations` - Add facts/notes to existing entities
4.  `delete_entities` - Remove entities and their relations
5.  `delete_observations` - Remove specific facts from entities
6.  `delete_relations` - Remove specific relationships
7.  `read_graph` - Read the entire knowledge graph
8.  `search_nodes` - Search entities by name/type/observation content
9.  `open_nodes` - Retrieve specific entities by name

**When to use:**

-   Need to track *who* relates to *what* and *how*
-   Building a structured knowledge base with explicit relationships
-   Tracking project context (people, components, dependencies)
-   Maintaining facts about users/preferences/history
-   Creating a personal CRM or project memory
-   Need to query relationships (e.g., "who works at company X?")
-   Storing learnings with clear connections between concepts

**When NOT to use:**

-   Need semantic/similarity search → Use Qdrant MCP instead
-   Relationships aren't important, just storage → Use Qdrant MCP instead
-   Simple note-taking without structure → Use filesystem or Qdrant
-   Temporary context (single session) → Just keep in conversation context

**Rate limits:** None (local JSONL file storage)

**Best practices:**

-   Entities: Use clear, unique names (e.g., "John_Smith", "ProjectX")
-   Relations: Always use active voice (e.g., "works_at", "depends_on")
-   Observations: Keep atomic (one fact per observation)
-   Entity types: Use consistent categorization (e.g., "person", "company", "project")
-   Relations are directed: order matters (from → to)

**Example structure:**

```
Entity: John_Smith (type: person)
    Observations: ["Speaks Spanish", "Prefers async communication"]
    Relations: John_Smith --works_at--> Anthropic
               John_Smith --contributes_to--> ProjectX

Entity: Anthropic (type: company)
    Observations: ["AI safety research", "Based in San Francisco"]
```

**Example use cases:**

-   Personal memory: Remember user preferences, context, history
-   Project documentation: Track components, dependencies, who owns what
-   Relationship mapping: Social/professional network graphs
-   Learning journal: Connect concepts, topics, resources with explicit links
-   Code understanding: Map relationships between modules, functions, data flows

**Why use:** Best tool for "X relates to Y" - maintains structured knowledge with queryable relationships

---

### Qdrant vs memory: quick decision guide

**Use Qdrant when:**

-   "Find things similar to this concept"
-   Semantic search is the main access pattern
-   Relationships between items aren't critical
-   Building a retrieval/search system

**Use Memory when:**

-   "Show me what relates to X"
-   Explicit relationships matter
-   Need structured graph queries
-   Building a knowledge/context management system

**Use both when:**

-   Complex knowledge base needs both similarity search AND relationship tracking
-   E.g., Qdrant for code snippets, Memory for tracking which projects use which patterns

---

### Code analysis & manipulation tools

#### Serena MCP ⭐ **[PRIMARY FOR CODE EDITING]**

**What it does:**

-   Language-server-powered semantic code navigation
-   IDE-grade symbol search (find_symbol, find_referencing_symbols)
-   Structural edits (rename, insert, replace at symbol level)
-   20+ languages supported

**When to use:**

-   Need semantic understanding of code (not just text)
-   Refactoring operations
-   Finding all references to a symbol
-   IDE-level code intelligence

**Rate limits:** None (local server)

**Why use:** Works at semantic level vs. whole-file operations

---

#### Semgrep MCP

**What it does:**

-   AST-aware security/bug/anti-pattern scanning
-   Pattern-based rules (built-in or custom)
-   Autofix suggestions
-   Local scanning (code never leaves machine)

**When to use:**

-   Security audits
-   Finding bugs/anti-patterns
-   Code quality checks
-   Custom rule enforcement

**Rate limits:** None (free community edition, local server)

---

#### Filesystem MCP

**What it does:** File operations (read/write/edit/create/list/delete/move)

**When to use:**
- Batch reading 10+ files (`read_multiple_files` - 30-60% token savings vs multiple Read calls)
- Analyzing project structures / directory trees (`directory_tree` returns JSON)

**When NOT to use:** Built-ins (Read/Write/Edit/Glob/Grep) already provide structured operations for 1-5 files and basic CRUD. Using the MCP in these cases simply adds overhead without benefit.

**Rate limits:** None (local)

---

#### Git MCP

**What it does:** All Git operations (status/diff/log/add/commit/branch/etc.)

**When to use:** Any Git-related task

**Rate limits:** None (local)

**Note:** Parent agent must run at repo root

## Decision trees by task type

### Finding code examples

```
START
    ↓
Need code from public repos?
    ├─ YES → Use Sourcegraph MCP (no rate limits)
    └─ NO  → Need GitHub-specific?
        ├─ YES → Use gh CLI or raw.githubusercontent.com via Fetch
        └─ NO  → Context7 for docs/examples from official sources
```

### Web research & information gathering

```
START
    ↓
What type of information?
    ├─ API docs/library info → Context7 MCP
    ├─ Current events/general web → Tavily MCP
    ├─ Semantic/conceptual search → Check Tavily first
    │                                ↓ If insufficient
    │                                Exa MCP (mind credits!)
    └─ Simple URL content → Fetch MCP
```

### Website crawling/scraping

```
START
    ↓
Single URL or simple extraction?
    ├─ YES → Tavily extract or Fetch MCP
    └─ NO  → Multiple pages/complex?
        ↓
        Try Tavily search/extract first
        ↓ Still need more?
        ↓
        Check if worth 1-10 Firecrawl credits
        ├─ YES → Use Firecrawl (track usage!)
        └─ NO  → Rethink approach or use Fetch iteratively
```

### Code manipulation

```
START
    ↓
Need semantic understanding?
    ├─ YES → Serena MCP (symbol-level operations)
    └─ NO  → Simple file edits?
        ├─ YES → Filesystem MCP
        └─ NO  → Security/bug scan → Semgrep MCP
```

### Memory & knowledge storage

```
START
    ↓
Need to store/retrieve information across sessions?
    ├─ NO  → Keep in conversation context
    └─ YES → What's the primary access pattern?
        ↓
        Do relationships between items matter?
        ├─ NO  → Need similarity/semantic search?
        │        ├─ YES → Qdrant MCP
        │        │        (find by meaning: "auth patterns" → OAuth/JWT/etc.)
        │        └─ NO  → Simple storage → Filesystem or notes
        │
        └─ YES → Need explicit relationships?
            ├─ YES → Memory MCP
            │        (track X relates to Y: person → works_at → company)
            └─ NO  → Qdrant MCP sufficient

Special case: Complex knowledge base?
    → Use BOTH:
        • Qdrant: Store searchable content
        • Memory: Track relationships between content

Example: Code snippet library
    → Qdrant: Store snippets, find by description
    + Memory: Track which projects/patterns use which snippets
```

## Rate limit management

### Critical limits to track

| Tool | Limit Type | Amount | Reset | Severity |
|------|-----------|---------|-------|----------|
| Firecrawl | One-time credit | 500 total | Never | 🟠 HIGH |
| Exa | One-time credit | $10 | Never | 🟠 HIGH |
| Tavily | Monthly | 1000 credits | 1st of month | 🟡 MEDIUM |
| Brave | Monthly | 2000 queries | Monthly | 🟡 MEDIUM |
| Sourcegraph | None | ∞ | N/A | 🟢 SAFE |
| Fetch | None | ∞ | N/A | 🟢 SAFE |

### Strategies

1.  **Always exhaust unlimited tools first** (Sourcegraph, Fetch)
2.  **Use monthly-reset tools before one-time credits** (Tavily/Brave before Exa)
3.  **Treat Firecrawl as emergency-only** - every use is permanent
4.  **Track Firecrawl usage manually** - no built-in counter
5.  **Front-load Tavily early in month** - will reset on 1st

### Cost-benefit analysis before using limited tools

**Before using Firecrawl, ask:**

-   Can Tavily do this? (Usually yes for search/extract)
-   Can Fetch do this iteratively? (Usually yes for known URLs)
-   Is this worth 1-10 permanent credits?
-   Is this a one-time need or recurring?

**Before using Exa, ask:**

-   Did Tavily fail to find it?
-   Do I need semantic search specifically?
-   Is this worth $X from one-time credit?

---

## Special cases & gotchas

### GitHub content

❌ **DON'T:** Use Fetch MCP on github.com URLs (not supported)

✅ **DO:** Use one of these:

1.  **Best:** `raw.githubusercontent.com/<user>/<repo>/<branch>/<file>` via Fetch
2.  **Also good:** `gh` CLI locally
3.  **For search:** Sourcegraph MCP
4.  **For analysis:** Clone locally + Git MCP + Serena MCP

### Documentation lookup

**Use this priority:**

1.  Context7 (official docs, version-specific)
2.  Tavily search (general web docs, tutorials)
3.  Sourcegraph (real-world usage examples)

### Multi-page content extraction

**Don't default to Firecrawl! Try this sequence:**

1.  Tavily search to find relevant pages
2.  Tavily extract on specific URLs
3.  If still insufficient, Fetch iteratively on known URLs
4.  **Last resort:** Firecrawl crawl (costs 1+ credits permanently)

### Memory & knowledge storage

**Memory MCP Best Practices:**

❌ **DON'T:**

-   Use passive voice for relations ("is_managed_by" → use "manages")
-   Create duplicate entities (check with `search_nodes` first)
-   Store multiple facts in one observation
-   Use complex entity names with spaces/special chars

✅ **DO:**

-   Use active voice relations: "John --works_at--> Company" (not "Company --employs--> John")
-   Use underscores in names: "John_Smith", not "John Smith"
-   Keep observations atomic: ["Speaks Spanish", "Graduated 2019"] (not ["Speaks Spanish and graduated in 2019"])
-   Use consistent entity types across the graph

**Qdrant vs Memory Decision:**

| Scenario | Use Qdrant | Use Memory | Use Both |
|----------|-----------|------------|----------|
| Store code snippets for "find similar" | ✅ | ❌ | Optional |
| Track who created what code | ❌ | ✅ | Recommended |
| Personal knowledge base | ✅ | ❌ | Optional |
| Project relationship map | ❌ | ✅ | N/A |
| Searchable docs + author tracking | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

**Data Persistence:**

-   **Qdrant**: Data in Docker volume (survives restarts) OR cloud (persistent)
-   **Memory**: JSONL file (location: `MEMORY_FILE_PATH` or default in server dir)
-   Both require explicit deletion - data persists across sessions

### When multiple tools can work

**Default to this order:**

1.  Unlimited tools (Sourcegraph, Fetch)
2.  Monthly-reset tools (Tavily, Brave)
3.  One-time credit tools (Exa)
4.  Lifetime-limited tools (Firecrawl - **avoid unless critical**)

---

## Summary: golden rules

### Search & research
1.  **Sourcegraph first for code**, Tavily first for web
2.  **Never use Firecrawl without checking if Tavily/Fetch can do it**
3.  **Track Firecrawl usage manually** - 500 limit is forever
4.  **Exa is powerful but limited** - use only when semantic search is critical
5.  **Fetch is unlimited** - use liberally for simple fetches
6.  **Context7 for official docs**, Sourcegraph for real examples
7.  **Front-load Tavily early each month** before credits run out

### Memory & knowledge
8.  **Qdrant for "find similar"**, Memory for "X relates to Y"
9.  **Both memory tools have no rate limits** - use freely for persistent storage
10. **Qdrant needs Docker OR cloud**, Memory works out of the box
11. **Memory relations in active voice** - "works_at" not "is_employed_by"
12. **Data persists across sessions** - remember to clean up when done

        │        Complex crawl? → Try Tavily, then consider Firecrawl
        │
        └─ NO  → Memory storage? → Qdrant (semantic) or Memory (graph)
            ↓
            Files? → Filesystem
            ↓
            Git? → Git MCP
