# Useful, uncovered roles in V2 ported to V3 structure by Gemini

> **Remaining roles to create**
> - **`competitive-analyst.md`**: This role focuses on business-centric competitive and market intelligence, which is outside the scope of the engineering-focused v3 superstar agents.
> - **`cpp-pro.md`**: The v3 agents are domain-oriented (e.g., security, reliability) rather than language-specific. There is no C++ specialist.
> - **`golang-pro.md`**: Similar to the C++ agent, there is no Go-specific specialist in v3.
> - **`prompt-engineer.md`**: This is a meta-role focused on the craft of prompt design itself. The v3 agents are the output of prompt engineering, but none is designed to perform it as its primary function.
> - **`rust-pro.md`**: Like the C++ and Go agents, there is no Rust-specific specialist in v3.

## Researchers

> **Workflow: *how to research with these agents***
>
> 1.  The **Specifier** creates the research plan.
> 2.  The **Executor** executes the plan to gather all raw findings.
>     - It delegates per-source summarization and extraction tasks to the **Extractor**.
> 3.  The **Synthesizer** takes the Executor's raw findings and produces the final, synthesized answer(s).

### [Research specifier](research-specifier.md)

Use when you:

1. Have a broad, ambiguous or complex topic to research 
2. Need to turn it into a structured plan before work begins.

### [Research executor](research-executor.md)

Use to:

- Execute a structured research plan (such as one generated by the research specifier)
- Handle a straightforward research quer from start to finish

### [Research synthesizer](research-synthesizer.md)

Use to:

- Consolidate findings from multiple sources into a coherent, insightful analysis
- Identify themes, contradictions, and assess evidence from disparate research outputs
